This is the public code for my Android app on Google Play: "Smart Pantry".

Here you will find: 

•the kotlin classes I wrote to define and use navigation screens, the inventory item/inventory list data structure, the barcode scanner, permissions, cloud storage functions, alarms, etc.

•the app's manifest which incorporates all required permissions (camera for barcode scan,.notifications and alarms, internet permission for cloud storage, etc.) while disabling Google's GMS ad tracking permission.

•my gradle files and my loaded libs.versuons.toml which helps to keep my app/module level gradle clean.
